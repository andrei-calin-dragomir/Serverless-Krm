# **README: Testing Services on Your Kubernetes Cluster**

This guide explains various ways to test services deployed in your Kubernetes cluster, including services exposed through different types (e.g., `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`) and Knative services.

---

## **1. Testing ClusterIP Services**
ClusterIP services are only accessible within the Kubernetes cluster.

### **Method: Test from Within the Cluster**
1. **Deploy a Test Pod**:
   Use a temporary pod (e.g., `curl`) to access the service:
   ```bash
   kubectl run curlpod --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
   ```
2. **Access the Service**:
   Inside the test pod, curl the service's `ClusterIP`:
   ```bash
   curl <ClusterIP>:<PORT>
   ```
   Replace `<ClusterIP>` and `<PORT>` with the service's IP and port from:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service <service-name>
   ```

3. **Exit the Test Pod**:
   After testing, delete the pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod curlpod
   ```

---

## **2. Testing NodePort Services**
NodePort services expose a service on a port of every cluster node.

### **Method: Access Using Node IP and NodePort**
1. Get the NodePort assigned to your service:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service <service-name>
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   NAME         TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
   my-service   NodePort   10.96.0.1       <none>        80:32000/TCP      5m
   ```

2. Get the IP of a node:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes -o wide
   ```

3. Test the service using the node's IP and NodePort:
   ```bash
   curl http://<Node-IP>:<NodePort>
   ```

---

## **3. Testing LoadBalancer Services**
LoadBalancer services expose a service through an external IP, typically provisioned by a cloud provider or MetalLB in local setups.

### **Method: Access Using External IP**
1. Check if the service has an external IP assigned:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service <service-name>
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
   my-service   LoadBalancer   10.96.0.1       192.168.1.100   80:31245/TCP   5m
   ```

2. Test the service using the external IP:
   ```bash
   curl http://192.168.1.100
   ```

---

## **4. Testing Knative Services**
Knative services use host-based routing with custom domains.

### **Method 1: Using a Custom Domain**
1. Configure a wildcard DNS record for your domain (e.g., `*.knative.example.com`) pointing to the external IP of your Knative networking layer (e.g., Kourier):
   ```
   *.knative.example.com A <EXTERNAL-IP>
   ```

2. Deploy a test Knative service:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: helloworld
     namespace: default
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - image: gcr.io/knative-samples/helloworld-go
           env:
           - name: TARGET
             value: "Knative World"
   ```

   Apply it:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f helloworld.yaml
   ```

3. Access the service using its hostname:
   ```bash
   curl http://helloworld.default.knative.example.com
   ```

### **Method 2: Using External IP Without DNS** (Not Implemented)
1. Retrieve the external IP of your Knative networking layer:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service kourier -n kourier-system
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
   kourier   LoadBalancer   10.97.136.177   192.168.1.240   80:30921/TCP   10m
   ```

2. Replace the domain part of the Knative service URL with the external IP:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Host: helloworld.default.knative.example.com" http://192.168.1.240
   ```

---

## **5. Testing Services Using Port Forwarding**
Port forwarding allows you to access services without exposing them externally.

### **Method: Forward a Local Port to the Service**
1. Forward a local port to the service:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/<service-name> <LOCAL_PORT>:<SERVICE_PORT>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/my-service 8080:80
   ```

2. Access the service locally:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

---

## **6. Testing with Logs and Events**
If a service isnâ€™t responding, inspect the logs and events.

### **Check Logs**
Inspect the logs of pods backing the service:
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=<app-label>
```

### **Check Events**
Review cluster events for errors:
```bash
kubectl get events -n <namespace>
```

---

## **7. Testing Autoscaling for Knative Services**
Knative services scale pods based on traffic.

1. Generate traffic:
   ```bash
   for i in {1..100}; do curl -s http://helloworld.default.knative.example.com; done
   ```

2. Monitor pod scaling:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n default
   ```

---

## **8. Testing with Ingress or API Gateway**
If your cluster uses an ingress controller (e.g., NGINX, Istio), test through the ingress gateway.

1. Check the ingress configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress
   ```

2. Access the ingress endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://<INGRESS-HOST>/<PATH>
   ```

---

## **9. Testing with External Tools**
- **Browser**: Open the service URL in a browser.
- **Postman**: Test APIs with custom headers or authentication.
- **cURL/Wget**: Automate requests and observe responses.

By following these methods, you can comprehensively test services deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. If you encounter issues, refer to logs, events, and configuration files to debug further.
